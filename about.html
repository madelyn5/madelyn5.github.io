            <p class="content">I am a junior at the University of Utah majoring in bioinformatics and minoring in computer science.
                I have taken many rigorous classes and maintained a 4.0 GPA. I am fascinated by the intersection of computer science,
                math, and biology. Upon the completion of my undergraduate program, I plan on earning a graduate degree. I have experience
                working in research labs, both at my home university, and at Montana State University. I would love to continue with research,
                particularly in bioinformatics.
